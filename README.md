# Maze-Solving Program

## Overview

This project was created to solve mazes using three different search algorithms: Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), and A*. The program generates random mazes, applies the search algorithms, and provides visualizations and statistics about the solution paths.

# Useage

1. Run the main.py script.
2. Select a maze number to observe from 1 to 10 in the terminal.
3. Choose an algorithm (DFS, BFS, A*) in the terminal to visualize the solution paths and statistics.
4. View the maze animation and results for the chosen algorithm and maze.

## Dependencies

The program relies on the following Python libraries:

- `matplotlib`: Used for maze visualization and animation.
- `numpy`: Used for array operations in the visualization process.

To install the required dependencies, use the following commands:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
```
